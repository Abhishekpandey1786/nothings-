      <p>
        $0.00 commission applies to online U.S. equity trades, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and options ($0.65 per contract fee) in a Fidelity retail account only for Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC retail clients. Sell orders are subject to an activity assessment fee (from $0.01 to $0.03 per $1,000 of principal). There is an Options Regulatory Fee (from $0.03 to $0.05 per contract), which applies to both option buy and sell transactions. See the <a href="#" class="fidelity-legal-link">Fidelity.com/commissions</a> for details. Employee equity compensation transactions and accounts managed by advisors or intermediaries through Fidelity Clearing & Custody Solutions¬Æ are subject to different commission schedules.<br><br>
        Options trading entails significant risk and is not appropriate for all investors. Certain complex options strategies carry additional risk. Before trading options, please read <a href="#" class="fidelity-legal-link">Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options</a>. Supporting documentation for any claims, if applicable, will be furnished upon request.<br><br>
        ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.<br><br>
        4.00% rate available for debit balances over $1,000,000.00. Fidelity's base margin rate effective since 03/18/2020, is 7.075%.<br><br>
        Tax-smart investment techniques are applied in providing discretionary investment management but are not applied to a limited basis, at the discretion of the portfolio manager, primarily with respect to determining when assets in a client account should be contributed and/or sold in order to realize a taxable gain or loss. There are no guarantees as to the effectiveness of the tax-smart investment techniques in seeking to reduce or minimize the impact of taxes, or whether tax liabilities owed may be generated by a given transaction. Investment minimums apply. Discretionary investment management is provided by Fidelity Personal and Workplace Advisors LLC, a registered investment advisor, for a fee.<br><br>
        Fidelity commissioned Corporate Insight to study online bond pricing. The study compared online bond prices for retail investors from three brokers (Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo) that offer corporate and municipal bonds for comparison to Fidelity's standard online pricing. The study reviewed online bond prices for more than 27,000 municipal and corporate inventory matches from January 28 through March 2, 2020. To compare municipal bond prices, the study calculated the difference between the prices of matching corporate and municipal bond inventory at Fidelity, including Fidelity's 5 cent per bond mark-up on the price of the same bonds from the three brokers, then averaging the differences of the financial services firms. The analysis included only retail trades in municipal bonds only, as the three brokers in the study do not offer non-investment grade bonds for purchase online. More information about the study is available at <a href="#" class="fidelity-legal-link">Fidelity.com/buybonds</a>.<br><br>
        <b>Minimum markup or markdown of $19.95 applies if traded with a Fidelity representative. For U.S. Treasury purchases traded with a Fidelity representative, a flat charge of $19.95 per trade applies. A $250 maximum applies to all trades, and a $50 minimum applies to bonds maturing in one year or less. Rates are for U.S. dollar-denominated bonds; additional fees and minimums apply for non-dollar bond trades. Other conditions may apply.</b> Yields and market values will fluctuate, so that investments, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. The total cost of the transaction and the total, or "yield to worst," yield will be provided on the confirmation. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC, our affiliate, National Financial Services LLC, may separately mark up or mark down the price of a security and may realize a trading profit or loss on the transaction.<br><br>

        Zero account minimums and Zero account fees apply to retail brokerage accounts only. Account minimums may apply to certain account types (e.g., managed accounts) and/or the purchase of some Fidelity mutual funds that have a minimum investment requirement. Expenses charged by investments (e.g., mutual funds), underlying fund expenses still apply. There may also be commissions, interest charges, and other expenses associated with transacting or holding specific investments (e.g., mutual funds), or selecting certain account features or types (e.g., managed accounts.) Additionally, accounts that have been opened through, or are maintained in, connection with your workplace benefits, may incur additional fees or restrictions. See the applicable account agreement for details.<br><br>
